  * "Your web browser is a trainwreck. It is one of the most adversarial programming environments that Satan has ever created."
  * "There's a dirty little secret about the Web. And that secret is that the aggregate Web protocol is actually a huge disaster."
  * "Each browser will fail you in different ways. And this is heartbreaking."
  * "These browsers are murderous thieves. And so what they do is they present you a flaky, semi-consistent set of APIs."
  * 'So take my hand, if you will, and join me on the garden path I like to call "Why the Suicide Rate for Web Developers is 89%".'
  * "Some of these DOM trees are vibrant and full of life, they're overflowing with joy. Other of these DOM trees are somewhat more minimal, but they still possess certain tree-like characteristics. And other DOM trees are so horrifying that I don't feel comfortable discussing them in polite conversation."
  * "So, in conclusion, we think that Web browsers have a lot of potential. Now, of course, when someone tells you you have a lot of potential, that means that you're actually failing right now."

  * "The JavaScript language basically is like being inside an insane person's brain; it was very disturbing."
  * "I basically determined that JavaScript arrays are best described as array-list-dictionary combined multi-type objects. [...] And they remember things they shouldn't remember, and they just really make me feel uncomfortable."
  * Regarding The Rhino Book's weasel-word-filled description of "array-like" objects:
    * "What the [deleted expletive] am I reading? Am I hallucinating this? Am I having a stroke? Am I reading a book that was written by the devil?"
    * "'actually do occasionally'. That makes me want to drink bleach."
    * "but for some reason we're okay with these [weasel] words being used to describe a scripting language that runs banking websites"
  * "I'd really like for my online financial transactions to be implemented in a programming language that actually knows what an array is."
  * "if you're a JavaScript programmer, and you actually rely on automatic semicolon insertion, if hitting the semicolon key is too much work for you, you're lazy, and you're going to get diabetes. For sure."
  * "And that's a valid point. There weren't a lot of black people in *Tron*."
  * "It's not this book's fault that it's describing a nightmare world." (Regarding *JavaScript: The Definitive Guide* AKA The Rhino Book)
  * "The Feature Factory is this attitude that a lot of browser vendors have, [...] and web developers have. They just want to keep on adding new features as quickly as possible, but they often don't spend the time to think about the security or robustness implications of those features."
  * "I am not against these JavaScript frameworks. [...] However, I will say there are too many JavaScript frameworks. Far too many. So, what percentage of frameworks do I think should be deleted? Roughly 99.7% of them. So I guess that in practice, I am against JavaScript frameworks."
  * "We've got a client-side solution. We've got a server-side solution. We've got a story for mobile. And if it doesn't move, we've got a story for stationary objects too."
  * "There is no reason for anything happy to ever happen on the web, ever. Every website I've been to has been at least partially massively disappointing."
  * "The educational system has failed web programmers."
  * "So whenever someone comes up to you and says 'Let's add a new feature' [to the web platform], just punch 'em right in the face."
  * "We all know we shouldn't use DOM0 event handlers. We all do it anyway, because we're all sick in the head."
  * "When you push out new [web platform] features and you don't think about the implications, you [create monkey Jesus](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-19349921)."
