## Summary of "Influence" by Cialdini

### Intro
higher priced sells better if buyers uninformed (jewelry tourists; expensive = good; price inflated falsely)
Favors granted more often when reason for request given using keyword "because", even if reason not informative ("may I use the xerox because I have to make some copies?")
We tend to look at a single highly representative factor (rule of thumb) when making a decision, due to cognitive laziness brought about by info/busyness overload, complex, fast paced env; don't typically do extensive analysis
Alfred North Whitehead: "civilization advances by extending the number of operations we can perform without thinking about them"
Contrast Principle: differences between items exaggerated if diff items presented to us in succession. If buy expensive item, overpriced accessories seem more reasonable/cheap by contrast. Good product seems great in contrast to bad product shown initially.


Six principles:

### Reciprocation
Reciprocation: we should repay others' deeds in kind
Favors obligate us ("much obliged" = "thank you")
Obligates us even when we dislike the favor-giver (cf Hare Krishnas giving out unsolicited flowers, refusing their return, and getting donations back instead, from conservative businesspeople)
Cf free samples, campaign contribs, polit "logrolling"
Jonestown woman who refused favor from Jones and thus found will to reject his suicide cmd
Works when favor is uninvited; giver can dictate form of requested return favor; Favors can be unfairly unequal
Psychologically difficult/impolite to turn down some favors
"Pressure to reciprocate a gift, but not to purchase an unwanted commercial product"; so charities position free address labels as gifts
Being indebted is psychologically uncomfortable
We don't want to be seen as moochers
Reciprocal Concession: Rejection-Then-Retreat: make large request intended to be rejected, then make smaller genuine request, requestee is more likely to accept since requester has made (insincere) concession; request doesn't have to be small, just comparatively smallER
Contrast principle makes 2nd request seem even smaller & more reasonable
And if 1st request agreed to, then bigger win; no-lose!
Rejection technique also leads to greater follow-thru than direct request
People feel more satisfied about & responsible for the agreement for having gotten the concession
HowToSayNo: decline initial favor (difficult & mean), recognize (post favor) the favor as in fact a sales strategy which as such does not require reciprocation


### Consistency
After committing to a decision, we feel more certain about it
We want to feel (& look to others) as consistent
Faraday, when asked whether his hated rival was always wrong: "He's not that consistent."
Consistency means we don't need to make decisions repeatedly, we also don't have to confront worrisome implications of our choices; cf TranscendentalMedidation, we use consistency to actively silence our reasoning/logical faculties
Commitment mints consistency. Particularly written or public commitment. You change your self-perception to match your actions.
severe (painful or humiliating) initiations made group members commitment to group greater, found grp more valuable;  cf hazings
We feel committed when we chose to do something in the absence of strong outside pressures (eg big prizes/ threats)
ThrowingALowball - offering an inducement to make a certain choice, then taking away the inducement, knowing that consistency means we will have found other reasons to justify the choice, removing the original logical justification for the choice (typically a purchase decision)
HowToSayNo: recognize when it'd be foolish to be consistent; ask yourself "Knowing what I know now, would I still make the same decision?"

### Social Proof
Social Proof: we infer what is correct based on what others think is correct
Salespeople fake such evidence
eg canned laughter, priming of tip jars & collection plates w/ cash, fake long lines to get into clubs, "X is the best-selling brand of Y", fake man-on-the-street endorsers/interviews
the more similar to us others are, the stronger the proof they provide
Jonestown suiciders had no other context except other Jonestowners
HowToSayNo: recognize & reject anything using such fake evidence

### Liking
Liking: we tend to comply with requests from people we like (are physically attractive, similar to us (opinion, personality, background, lifestyle), who give us compliments, who we find familiar)
great passage on the classroom environment p178
group dynamics
   to create intergroup hostility, separate into groups, let groupmembers commiserate, then have groups compete
   to remove hostility, impose situations where intergroup cooperation is necessary & competition would be harmful to all
we like people associated, even irrelevantly/illogically, with good things (the converse is why people "shoot the messenger"; guilt by association; why car ads include hot women)
food, sex, celebs assoc with products
Asimov: "All things being equal, you root for your own sex, culture, locality, and what you want to prove is that you are better than the other person. Whomever you root for represents you; and when he wins, you win"
HowToSayNo: when you like someone, ask yourself why? Are your reasons good and the qualities not forged/forgable? Separate the seller from what he is selling.

### Authority
The Milgram Experiment
doctor errors that should have been caught via nurse double/sanity-checking not questioned since docs hold authority positions
use of actors playing docs in adverts
we are fooled by false authority conveyed by mere symbols of authority:
   titles: more grand title makes us perceive person as physically taller; vice-versa
cards with higher absolute dollar amounts seen as physically larger
   clothes/uniform
   trappings: eg luxury car
compliance trick: expert argues slightly against their own self-interest in order to seem impartial & gain your trust; then present countervailing advantage to offset the shortcoming they admitted, and exploit your trust in them
HowToSayNo: is the authority truly a relevant expert?


BE SURE TO MENTION THE JOB INTERVIEW APPEARANCE RESEARCH SOMEWHERE

### Scarcity
Humans respond more to potential loss than potential gain, even when the loss is only of an opportunity; using such phrasing increases compliance
Marketers fake scarcity or a deadline
We hate to lose freedoms we already have: Romeo&Juliet's defiance, defiance of censorship (people want to see censored works more and sympathize with the views of the censored work more; some deliberately get their works censored to invoke this) or other bans
We infer that scarce things must be better than abundant ones
We find "exclusive" information more persuasive than generally-available info
Newly-experienced scarcity produces greater rxn than const scarcity; revolutions tend to happen at a short sharp downturn that followed a period of upswing, the middle class rises up in resp to the loss of newly estab econ/soc freedoms, contrast to the constantly deprived lower class
Similarly, parents ought to enforce discipline consistently so as to not inadvertently estab and then take away freedoms from their children
When a product is scarce due to apparent/visible adversarial competition (even if fake) can make us jealous and thus convince us to buy now; equiv of feeding frenzy; powerful example is The Poseidon Adventure

HowToSayNo: recog your instinctual rxn as best you can & resist; does the product's actual value lie in its scarcity (eg status symbol, collector's item) or in its utility of use (most other stuff)? If the latter, disregard its scarcity as irrelevant.
