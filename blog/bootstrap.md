Why Bootstrap
  browser bugs
  not an artist
  CSS is arcane
How first involved
  date
  triaging issue tracker
  inundated with issues
  maintainers not active enough
  Haunt script horribleness
Simple refactorings to reduce duplication in Less source
Build system, since fat went AFK
Testability
Sauce Labs

LMVTFY
  validator.nu
  Scala Akka Spray
Rorschach
Savage
  the Sauce/Travis bug

Future: No Carrier
Future: [WebdriverCSS](https://github.com/webdriverio/webdrivercss-adminpanel) or Gemini

Tangent: The Web stack sucks
[all] [these] [browser] [bugs]
[how did this pass QA?]
"leave your sense of logic at the door" indeed
N different vendors
design by committee prog langs in general
JS sucks
  preface: Python
  `this` craziness
  no integers craziness
  weak typing
  N different module systems
  Wat.
CSS sucks
  no module system
  all the selectors suck
  it's the future, where's my damn "has X child" selector yet
  or perhaps, IE sucks

HTML sucks
an advanced video game system with an obtuse and either primitive or oversimplified interface
"semantic"
  ARIA kinda sorta
but it's popular
but, Web Components!
  damn overcomplicated
Tangent: designer hate
  native vs. custom
  they give you the world, and you toss it aside
  you vs. Apple/Microsoft/GoogleAndroid
  folks are familiar with native anyway
